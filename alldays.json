          "description": "Whether your project is big data or enterprise integration, Spring XD makes it easy to solve common big data integration problems such as data ingestion and export, real-time analytics, and batch workflow orchestration.  In this workshop we will cover stream creation, batch job execution and high availability.  You will learn how to create streams to capture live data from various sources (hdfs,tcp, no sql, RDBMS), filter and modify the data as well as capture counts then output this data to various sinks (hdfs,tcp, no sql, RDBMS).  Also covered is how to create batch workflow solutions that span traditional use-cases such as moving data between flat files and relational databases as well as Hadoop use-cases.\r\nThe best news is that you don't need to code anything up to get going, no build scripts, no IDE, no maven coordinates.  If you are working on a big data, Spring Integration, Spring Batch project this workshop is for you.  This is a hands-on workshop so bring your laptop!",

The changes include APIs like JAX-RS 2, JMS 2, Java Batch, Java EE Concurrency, WebSocket, JSON-P and JSF 2.2. The workshop will introduce these changes in a step-by-step fashion using a realistic end-to-end application deployed on GlassFish 4 using NetBeans.\r\n\r\nAlthough the primary focus will be on the new APIs and features, we will take a holistic approach to the workshop and also cover the features introduced in Java EE 5 and Java EE 6 such as the ones in EJB 3, CDI, JPA, Bean Validation and JSF focused on annotations, intelligent defaults, type-safe, powerful, fluent APIs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the workshop, you will have a broad introduction to Java EE 7 and will be ready to write your own applications having already written quite a bit of code in the workshop.",

Well there is no better way to learn a new paradigm than by actually seeing it implemented.  In this workshop we'll take a working code example and transform it into the functional paradigm all in Java 7.  We'll step through everything from higher-order functions, function purity and even to some levels of immutability.  At the end, we'll show how we can make use of Java 8's lambdas by very simple changes to the code that we've already refactored.\r\nAt the end, you should be able to take the concepts that you learn from this workshop and start using them the next day at work!",

          "description": "\r\nComponent-oriented UI development has been popular for over twenty years, with the introduction of Visual Basic. The promise is simple: packaged reusable code that makes powerful widgets like grids, toolbars, menus, smart input controls, panels, media players, charts, graphs, trees, image viewers, and so on, easy to integrate into applications.\r\n\r\nOn the web, frameworks such as ASP.NET, JSF, Tapestry, Wicket, GWT, and Vaadin take advantage of component architectures, and there is no shortage of JavaScript/HTML5 widget libraries such as YUI, KendoUI, jQuery UI, Bootstrap, ExtJS, and so on. Each of these frameworks allows developers to build their own custom components, but those components won’t work outside of the framework. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a standard way to build a UI component that runs in a browser? A component model that is part of the open web?\r\n\r\nFinally, there is: Web Components, an emerging standard from the Web Applications Working Group (WAWG). Web Components consists of five different standards: Templates, Decorators,\r\nCustom Elements, Shadow DOM, and Imports. Together, these standards allow you to build custom widgets with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS that can be used just like native HTML elements.\r\n\r\nSince the standards are not fully supported in all browsers, you need a library to support them in non-compliant browsers. Google’s Polymer does just this, and more.\r\n\r\nCome to this workshop to learn about these exciting new technologies hands-on.",

How do we deal with things like grouping functionality, loose coupling or dependency injection? \r\nJoin this journey where we’ll look at code we usually write when developing business applications and how to refactor this using functional paradigms, and more importantly, see if these provide us with any value. \r\n",

          "description": "Agile works great, when it works. It tends to be most successful in small companies, with small teams that can work completely independently of others. It tends to fail when more teams are involved, when there are dependencies between them. Even though we're \"doing Scrum\", it still just doesn't yield the promised benefits. When agile fails it can be disappointing and costly. People get blamed, agile gets blamed, the training gets blamed, and the organizational culture gets blamed. Yet companies keep trying. Many companies make multiple attempts to transition to agile because they've bought in to the underlying principles of agile and see it as a solution to their problem hitting dates, their long time to market, their slow return on investment, and their quality problems.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll examine 8 causes for Agile's failure in large enterprises, and why starting a transformation with culture or even practices isn't the solution. We'll examine why the ultimate solution begins with putting in place the certain organizational structures and planning a journey through predictability on our way to adaptability. Specifically, to begin we need a thoughtful mix of product or feature teams and component or service teams, as cross functional as practicable in each instance; agile structures above the team; and appropriate agile governance at the portfolio and program management layers. This creates an environment in which agile can begin to stick, can begin to deliver value, and creates a platform from which we can move on to increased agility.",

These small highly specialized apps are called microservices, and when combined, provide the ultimate cloud based application that scales, is fault tolerant, and is easy to maintain and deploy.

This will be the third presentation of a series of presentations that began greater than one year ago to evangelize the benefits of Docker.  The scope of content spans from a development environment to a hybrid PaaS, and how Containerization is an enabler of architectural choice, innovation, scalability, and polyglot solutions.\r\n\r\nThe basics of Docker will be examined including repositories, brief discussion about managing and monitoring Docker containers, service discovery, and security.  New and emerging technologies will be a constant theme, particularly about microservices, in addition to the ongoing evolution of the market and what the future may bring.  Common organizational issues (and tactical solutions) that may impede successful decomposition and migration of legacy monoliths will be discussed, including security, DevOps and refactoring.\r\n\r\nHypothetical architectures will be described for building progressively more robust and complex applications and deployment models.  The goal is to highlight the power, flexibility and scalability that containers enable.  \r\n\r\nExamples will start simple, from a local development environment, that is a simple two container setup that encapsulate a database and application tier.  Subsequent discussion will involve progressively more complex and robust deployments that include features such as service discovery, automatic load balancing, and abstractions to simplify linking of containers including service gateways.

          "description": "More than 55 years ago John McCarthy had an insanely great idea called Lisp. Lisp marked the beginning of functional programming, interpreters, high-level metaprogramming, garbage collection, and much more. Yet after such auspicious beginnings the idea of Lisp has since faded and many of its innovations have been adopted by much more popular programming languages. Until recently Lisp even appeared doomed to fade into obscurity but several things have conspired to make Lisp somewhat cool again - one of these is Clojure, a fun modern Lisp targeting the Java Virtual Machine.\r\n\r\nHowever the Web doesn't speak JVM bytecodes. It speaks JavaScript - thus the cornucopia of languages that now compile to JavaScript. The most well known include GWT, CoffeeScript, and more recently Dart and TypeScript. However none of these represent a real break from the status quo.\r\n\r\nJohn McCarthy's insanely great idea still has a lot to offer the Web and we'll see how with ClojureScript, an implementation of Clojure that targets JavaScript.",

It was written from the start to be a lean, portable and extensible framework that lets developers actively manage containers the same way Google does.  Containers back all of Google's internet services from Search to Gmail and offer tremendous advantages in terms of efficiency and manageability.  Google has been working closely with the broader software community to make containers accessible, and major companies like Microsoft, Red Hat and IBM are also backing the technology and making sure that it runs in a multi-cloud world. During this session we will provide an overview on the Kubernetes framework, discuss how it works to bring active management to the containers world, and give a glimpse into the future as we talk about what is coming next with the project.",

How can we bring these measurements into our automated build process to ensure that our site is getting better, and not worse?\r\n\r\nPhantomJS, a headless WebKit with JavaScript API, gives us the ability to create lightweight performance measurement tools with JavaScript (and so much more). In this talk we’ll review how PhantomJS has influenced some of the web’s top ranking sites and how it can be put into any automated build to produce reporting on performance. We’ll look at how other open source projects such as WebPageTest.org measure up to this approach and see when one might be better over the other.",

It may also tremendously simplify responsive layouts that are dependent on commonly complicated grid models.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will introduce the mechanics of the Flexible Box Model and demonstrate its capability for simplifying markup and styling.

Writing correct and useful benchmarks is hard, and verification of the results is difficult and prone to errors. When done right, benchmarks guide teams to improve the performance of their systems. When done wrong, hours of effort may result in a worse performing application, upset customers or worse! In this talk, we will discuss what you need to know to write better benchmarks.

          "description": "In this session, we will take a look at Angular - the powerful MVVM SPA framework from Google. We will discuss some of the terminology that Angular offers, and see how we can use that to develop highly interactive, dynamic web applications. See “Detail” for a list of topics I cover and the Github repo URL\r\n\r\nIn this session we will take a look at Angular and using it to develop rich web applications. Angular embraces HTML and CSS, allowing you to extend HTML towards your application, and uses plain JavaScript which makes your code easy to reuse, and test.\r\n\r\nNote: This is an intro level talk. It is targeted towards developers who are curious about Angular and want to learn about the fundamental features and concepts in Angular.\r\n\r\nTopics Covered -\r\n\r\nBootstrapping an AngularJS application using ng-app\r\nng-init and the evaluation {{ }} directive\r\nA brief look at $rootScope and scoping rules\r\nng-model\r\nControllers, Dependency Injection, and the View-Model\r\nLooping using ng-repeat\r\nForms using ng-form, form validation and submission in AngularJS\r\nng-messages to display form validation messages to the user\r\nAngular provided filters and custom filters\r\nGitHub URL - https://github.com/looselytyped/angudone-workshop/tree/solutions",

          "description": "Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. User Experience is certainly one of the latest buzzwords, but...what do User Experience professionals actually do? \r\n\r\nHonestly, most UX folks, especially generalists, do a little bit of everything - from user interface design and information architecture to usability studies and market research. This workshop concentrates on one of the most important things UX professionals do: help businesses focus on the customer. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will roll up your sleeves and actually participate in some UX research activities. You'll learn how even a little bit of customer interaction can lead to huge insights... and then you'll learn how to interpret those insights and incorporate them back into your Agile project. \r\n\r\nInformation for Review Team: \r\nIn the first activity, the participants will play the role of the customer. I guide them through a couple of exercises to create an outline of what customers need and want from a product. I’ll use an accessible example, like a web application for paying a bill online. \r\n\r\n1. In four or five areas around the room, put a piece of poster paper on the wall. \r\n2. Split the participants into groups.\r\n3. Have each group fill in boxes on the paper to describe the attributes of a particular kind of user but focus on the tasks that user needs or wants to accomplish (like a brand new user who needs to pay a late bill). This includes describing what helps or impedes them from doing their task. It also includes describing the user in useful ways (this person is typically early 20’s, in a hurry, has kids, etc.)\r\n4. Rotate the groups to add/subtract/move things from the previous groups list.\r\nOnce this is complete, I’ll demonstrate how this information can be used to create a “quick and dirty” persona, as well as describe how additional research can be combined with this activity to create a more formal persona.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll lead the participants through an activity where they play the role of the business trying to prioritize stories. I’ll show them how they can use the personas to help guide them and how to help avoid common the trap of thinking that just because they know the business intimately they automatically know what the customer would need or want. \r\n\r\nPrerequisite Knowledge: \r\nGeneral Agile knowledge, particularly SCRUM framework, is assumed.",

The Java DSL for Spring Integration is essentially a facade for Spring Integration. The DSL provides a simple way to embed Spring Integration Message Flows into your application using the fluent Builder pattern together with existing Java and Annotation configurations from Spring Framework and Spring Integration as well. While not requiring Java 8, the use of Java 8 Lambda expressions in the DSL makes for even more succinct configuration.\r\n\r\nThis session takes a deep dive into using the DSL to define a reasonably complex integration application. While concentrating on the use of Java 8 Lambda expressions we will also cover pre java 8 constructs for those users not yet ready to make the move.",

AngularJS changed the way developers built apps for the web, and now Ionic has changed the way developers build hybrid apps on mobile. \r\n\r\nEasy-to-use, beautiful, and ready to perform, Ionic is an open source framework made for hybrid apps.

With built-in time zone and DST support you no longer have to worry about roaming around under the scorching hot sun.  Accurately calculate out how long you have to infect the villagers before you decompose using Durations.

With the power of Java 8, eradicating the human race with a highly infectious virus has never been easier!\r\n\r\nThis presentation is designed to teach Java Date and Time APIs to the undead, but the living are welcome to be our \"guests\".

          "description": "Developers will often adopt a framework long before it is prudent, or will cling to a framework long after it has become irrelevant.  This phenomenon of picking and sticking with a framework for all the wrong reasons affects everything we do, from the estimates we give, to the people we hire, and the companies we want to work for.  Attempts to mitigate the risk of poor framework choices are often thwarted by the ability of a single developer to introduce a questionable framework that then gets adopted by their peers.  The effect is magnified by the fact that many developers would rebel and quit if they could not use their framework of choice.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore this phenomenon in an attempt to find it's root causes.  This meandering journey will take us down the dark paths of the recruiting industry's keyword obsession, academia's attempts to prepare graduates for the real world, as well as the natural human instinct to play with new and interesting things - regardless of the cost.   Once we understand the nature of the problem, an attempt will be made to identify potential solutions, from those as uninspiring as training courses to as extreme as weekend hackathons.   \r\n",

          "description": "Production debugging is hard, and it’s getting harder. With architectures becoming more distributed and code more asynchronous, pinpointing and resolving errors that happen in production is no child’s game. This session covers some essential tools and more advanced techniques Java developers can use in their code to debug live servers and resolve errors quickly.\r\n\r\nWe’ll cover five techniques for distributed logging, and some of the pitfalls which make resolution much harder and can even lead to downtime. \r\n\r\nWe’ll review how some of the new language features introduced in Java 8 such as Lambda expressions and Nashorn JavaScript can actually make debugging harder, and what are the things you can do to overcome them.\r\n\r\nLast, we’ll also touch on some little known JDK tools that give you super deep visibility into a live JVM, without having to restart it or use a debugger.",

While the details will be in Om, an immutable user interface toolkit written in ClojureScript over Facebook’s React, the talk will be primarily focused on high level concepts easily ported to JavaScript. We’ll dive in and see how trees of JavaScript arrays can permit building these efficient immutable collections. Then we’ll see how embracing immutable values dramatically simplifies some classic hard problems in client side programming including but not limited to undo, error playback, and online/offline synchronization.",

          "description": "With a fragile test suite, the Continuous Testing that's vital to Agile just isn't feasible. If you truly want to automate the execution of a broad test suite—embracing unit, component, integration, functional, performance, and security testing—during continuous integration, you need to ensure that your test suite is up to the task. How do you achieve this? This session will provide tips on ensuring that your tests are up to the task:\r\n•\tLogically-componentized: Tests need to be logically-componentized so you can assess the impact at change time. When tests fail and they're logically correlated to components, it is much easier to establish priority and associate tasks to the correct resource.\r\n•\tIncremental: Tests can be built upon each other, without impacting the integrity of the original or new test case.\r\n•\tRepeatable: Tests can be executed over and over again with each incremental build, integration, or release process.\r\n•\tDeterministic and meaningful:  Tests must be clean and deterministic. Pass and fail have unambiguous meanings.  Each test should do exactly what you want it to do—no more and no less.  Tests should fail only when an actual problem you care about has been detected. Moreover, the failure should be obvious and clearly communicate what went wrong.\r\n•\tMaintainable within a process: A test that's out of sync with the code will either generate incorrect failures (false positives) or overlook real problems (false negatives).  An automated process for evolving test artifacts is just as important as the construction of new tests.  \r\n•\tPrescriptive workflow based on results: When a test does fail, it should trigger a process-driven workflow that lets team members know what's expected and how to proceed. This typically includes a prioritized task list.\r\n\r\n",

          "description": "Hey lads, lemme tell ya a story.\r\nOnce upon a time, we're talking about the year 2001, a few people had an amazing idea. They were thinking about something that would change the world. It would make the world easy and give programmers almost unlimited power! It was simply referred to as JSR 107, one of the least things to change in the upcoming future. But those pals were way ahead of their time and nothing really happend. So time passed by and by and by and over the years it was buried in the deep catacombs of the JCP. Eventually, in 2011, two brave knights took on the fight and worked themselves through all the pathlessness, to finalize it in 2014. Lads you know what I'm talking about, they called it the \"Java Caching API\" or in short \"JCache\". Yes you heard me, a Java standard for Caching!\r\n\r\nA software system cannot possibly imagined without Caching today and it was time for a standard. No matter if you want to cache database queries, generated HTML or results of long running calculations, new systems have to reach a critical mass to be successful. Therefore caching becomes a First-Class-Citizen of application landscape, the principle of Caching First. JCache has grown for 13 years to it's final success and had an amazing Co-Spec-Lead, Greg Luck - the inventor of EHcache.",

          "description": "Hey!  You.  It’s time to add a few skills to your toolbelt.  You may be safely living in the world of server MVCs and ORMs, but sooner or later, it’s going to be time to deal with the client-side beast….\r\n\r\nThe asynchronous beast.  1, 2, 3 will become 1, 3, 2.  Code inside harmless little functions will get called sometime you don’t even know about, and everything you knew about the order of programming will go out the window. \r\n\r\nYour mind will melt. And you will drink your 4th Coke of the afternoon, only to be unable to sit still. \r\n\r\nDon’t let this happen.  Come to this presentation and learn about asynchronous programming. \r\n\r\nYou’ve probably seen a peek of asynchronous code: handing off “functions” to ajax calls that magically get called, or wiring up jQuery handlers that will call a function when a link is clicked.  If you ever had to make a second, and a third, and then a fourth ajax call from either of those callbacks, you know what I’m talking about.  It’s commonly referred to as “callback hell”, and it’s unfortunately easy to find your way there.  \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we’ll cover various techniques for dealing with asynchronous programming.  Spanning Android, iOS and Javascript, we’ll go over patterns to solve common client problems, pitfalls of each and great libraries on each platform.\r\n\r\nYou’ll come away with a heavier toolbelt, and some tidbits lodged deep into your brain that will fire off the next time you start to head down towards the dreaded callback hell.

          "description": "So you know that Java is a Managed language and us, as Java developers don't worry about mundane things like memory allocation (PFFFT!), and sometimes we get into a sense of the secure, letting the super incredible JVM take care of everything for us. But alas, with complacency we can get in trouble. Memory leaks are real (--Insert horror scream here--), and we must understand how these happen! \r\n\r\nIn this session we will go into how the JVM allocates and keeps \"things around\", and then how memory leaks are inadvertently created. Not just that, but we will also deep dive in how to find and fix these leaks by using Free tools like VisualVM. We will walk through Strong/Weak and Phantom references and review unintended leaks (like using anonymous inner classes that have strong references). If you program in the J2SE space, or if your are an Android app developer, or even a Java EE who has to do a lot of Session and/or Batch processing this session is for you!\r\n\r\nThe title is a reference to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1dqJPsSa4)\r\n\r\n",

          "description": " The developer community is doing work right now that is being used to write new W3C standards for web components. Think of encapsulation or OOP. Google's approach is Polymer, a library which provides a \"sugaring layer\" of features. Polymer is built on top of platform.js, which extends the functionality of your browser to include next-gen features required to run web components. Some of the new features involved include building modular elements inside of HTML Templates, support to write your own unique Custom Elements with custom named tags (eg. <fancy-button></fancy-button> could be functioning html), the Shadow DOM which protects styles from bleeding over, and Model Driven Views (front end to back end data binding). Google's Platform.js is also being used by Mozilla X-Tags. \r\n\r\n It is important to note that Polymer is forward facing only and does not attempt to conform to any sort of backwards compatibility; only the last two versions of any given browser are supported and there is no intention to appeal to previous standards. Polymer is not a programming language, it's just an opinionated library. The core polymer team are also key contributors to W3C's evolving standards for web components. Work being done now is for tomorrow's standard, so we can get a fresh perspective on how the web should work instead of simply conforming to legacy approaches.\r\n\r\nThe talk will include basic instructions for getting started with Polymer using NPM and Bower. We will discuss the role of web components in future standards. There will be a general outline of how Polymer and it's dependencies fits into the stack and what job each part of the stack preforms. \r\n\r\nWe will go over how to make custom elements so you can get started actually having fun with Polymer.",

It's a critical component to the User Experience...right?\r\n\r\nUXers internalize this belief, because they were raised on it. Before the web became interactive, it was information architecture that put UX designers on the map (or the job boards, rather). All those \"pages\" of static content had to be bucketed, filed, and organized. The navigation, with it’s top of the page prominence, was their claim to fame! But in our practice today, what is the very first thing that we hide when screen size gets tight?\r\n\r\nThe navigation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are starting to see that users actually downright ignore the nav, even when it’s visible in all of its desktop,docked glory. Users go straight for the big shiny objects - the content on the page.\r\n \r\nSo, if we hamburgered our navigation on mobile, and people ignore it on desktop, how do we get people to flow through our site? Well, the content must become the navigation. This is where Object Oriented UX comes in.  OOUX helps create an efficient, elegant modular system.  UXers, designers, and developers reduce rework, and the end user will have a more consistent experience.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce OOUX, walk through examples, and show you how to incorporate it into your process.",

The standard is built on shadow DOM, customer HTML elements, HTML import and CSS sandboxing. While each of these is interesting by its own right, the combination of these tools has a potential to simplify web platform and empower developers building larger applications.\r\n\r\nThe value proposition is really close to that of component based frameworks like Vaadin: Make building good quality user interfaces easy with a powerful encapsulation. Are Java frameworks on a crash course with web components or could they complement each other?\r\n\r\nLet me present you A new research project that answers what Vaadin has to do with web components. Is Polymer related? How GWT fits in? Which is the right way to go - Java or JavaScript for the user interface layer? Or both?\r\n\r\nIn this session we will demo what Vaadin team has been building on top of web components standards for a while.

This talk will explore some of the differentiating and compelling features that Elasticsearch offers, as it becomes the defacto full-text provider for the enterprise. Deploying Elasticsearch is a trivial endeavor, but knowing how to configure your cluster initially for optimal performance, is an art. In this presentation, I will share much of what I've learned in deploying and scaling-out massive Elasticsearch clusters that were designed from the ground up, optimized for performance with a specific use in mind. Some of the topics covered will focus on optimizing clusters, organizing and retrieving data, disaster recovery, and avoiding failure and performance degradation in a running cluster. Common and not-so-common deployment scenarios will also be investigated, such as: Log aggregation, Full-Text search, and its use in a CQRS architecture.",

Most of these applications, however, remain almost invisible, hiding inconspicuously in the bowels of the JDK directory structure. Yet these under appreciated tools contain some powerful functionality for troubleshooting, monitoring and analysis of applications on the JVM. Tools such as jcmd, jstat, jmap, jhat among others should be in the ready arsenal of every Java (or any JVM language) poweruser.

A plethora of new tools have emerged over the last years to deal with the ever growing complexity of front-end development in a multi device world.Sass is one piece of the front-end system; a powerful tool that has addressed the short comings of CSS by bringing programming concepts to front-end developers and designers. \r\n\r\nIn this session we'll cover the core Sass feature set from a practical, daily use perspective. The goal is to introduce you to Sass concepts so that you leave feeling more comfortable with Sass and walk away with new Sassy insights to take back to your team or solo-practice as well as techniques for improving your front-end development process. \r\n\r\n### Topics\r\n\r\n* Sass data types: variables, maps, and lists\r\n* Mixins, extends, and functions\r\n* Control directives\r\n* File organization: partials, nesting, @import\r\n* Sass ecosystem: extensions and the community\r\n* Sass and the Node.js/IO.js ecosystem, including Ruby Sass and Libsass \r\n\r\n**N.B.**\r\n\r\nLearning is best learned by doing.

Just because you're writing code that doesn't include a GUI, don't think there isn't a user interface involved. An API is a user interface and many of the principles that go into designing a good GUI are just as applicable when creating the public interface for a package, a service, or even a single class.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll learn the fundamentals of good user interface design, techniques to help you deliver a great user experience, and how to apply them even when there's not a single pixel involved.\r\n",

This will include the code and tools I used to run the whole application. In particular I will show how this type of architecture was used to produce the mapping experience in FlatFluffy.

          "description": "Databases, servers and micro-services all set up automatically on a developer machine in a matter of minutes. Testing, staging and production environments built with the click of a button. Yesterday’s dream has become today’s reality, and we at JFrog have been doing it for several years with the help of tools like Vagrant, Chef, Artifactory and Jenkins.\r\nBut can we do better? Of course we can...thanks to Docker! By breaking up our monolithic environment into interconnected containers, we can achieve a faster setup and amazing flexibility. But with this flexibility come unprecedented headaches and challenges.\r\nIn this session we will talk about our experience migrating a complicated, multi-faceted dev environment from a Vagrant-Chef combo to Docker, and about the challenges and opportunities that this new setup brings.\r\n",
